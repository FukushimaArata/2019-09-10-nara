  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
{% endcomment %}


In recent years serious concerns about the reproducibility and transparency of research have arisen in many scientific disciplines. These concerns reveal a wide gap between scientific practice and scientific ideals, and threaten to erode public support for research. In this workshop we will provide hands-on training in robust techniques, tools and services (all free) to improve the reproducibility and transparency of archaeological research. Most of these tools relate to the R programming language, which is central to recent developments in social and natural sciences.

{% comment %}
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
{% endcomment %}
This workshop is suited to novices who have never used R before: <em>no</em> prior experience is necessary. The course is aimed at archaeologists doing research at all career stages.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
{% endcomment %}

{% comment %}
  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

<p>
  To participate in this workshop,
  you will need access to the software described below.
  In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported
    web browser</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions

        take too long and is not necessary for our Git lesson.
        After installing these tools, there won't be anything in your <code>/Applications</code>

        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.
        Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to

<h2 id="coc">Code of Conduct ‚úÖ</h2>
We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of
background or identity. However, we recognise that some groups in our community are subject to historical
and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group
can be on the basis of characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship,
familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion,
membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate
harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.

Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we
are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent
behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community,
regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:

written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership
of a specific group listed above causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through
<p>
  <ul>
      <li>stalking, following, or intimidation</li>
<li>the display of sexual or violent images</li>
<li>unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact</li>
<li>sustained disruption of talks, events or communications</li>
<li>incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm</li>
<li>continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop</li>
<li>publication of private communication without consent</li>
     </ul>
    </p>
<p>
Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to both.
  </p>
<p>
Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.
  </p>
<p>
Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
  </p>
<p>
This code of conduct is an adaptation of the one used by the Software Carpentry Foundation and is a modified version of that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki.
